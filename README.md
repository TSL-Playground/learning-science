**Job Description**
As a UROP working for the MIT Teaching Systems Lab (TSL) and Woodrow Wilson Academy of Teaching & Learning (the Academy), students will design playful tools for teaching teachers how to ground their instruction in learning science. Students will work on solo projects or tackle projects with peers – all deciding how the playground, its tools and games, and the learning sciences come together.  Students will build Video Games, Tabletop Games, Playful Objects, VR/AR/MR, Mobile Apps, or other tools for learning.


Visit the [Playground Portal](http://web.mit.edu/teachingsystems/playground/learning_science/portal/index.html), created by undergraduates over the summer of 2018.
